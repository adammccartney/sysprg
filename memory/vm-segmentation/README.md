Answers to problem set
======================

Questions are generated by running the `segmentation.py` simulation with
various different flags to simulate address translation in the context of
segmented memory. 

For `segmentation.py` (and a further readme) see the 
[ostep-homework source code] (https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-homework/tree/master/vm-segmentation)

Questions: 

1. Use a tiny address space to translate some addresses. 
Simple parameters with a few different random seeds:
```
segmentation.py -a 128 -p 512 -b 0 -l 20 -B 512 -L 20 -s 0
segmentation.py -a 128 -p 512 -b 0 -l 20 -B 512 -L 20 -s 1
segmentation.py -a 128 -p 512 -b 0 -l 20 -B 512 -L 20 -s 2
```
