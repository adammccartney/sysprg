# Makefile to build library used by all programs
#
# This make file relies on the assumption that each C file in this
# directory belongs in the library
#
# This makefile is very simple so that every version of make 
# should be able to handle it
#
include ../Makefile.inc

# The library build is "brute force" -- we don't bother with 
# dependency checking.
