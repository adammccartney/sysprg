cdecl is a program to translate C Declarations into English
===========================================================

c declarations are complicated. this program parses declarations so you don't
have to remember the complicated rules for reading them. It's based on the
pseudo code example from "expert c" by Peter van der Linden. It slightly
extends the version of the program that appears in K&R but does not go so far
as to implement error checking ... because life is short and you're smart.
